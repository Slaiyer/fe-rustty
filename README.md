## Intro

Rustty is a terminal UI library that provides a concise, elegant abstraction
over an underlying terminal device.

Rustty is based on the concepts of cells and events. The terminal display is an 
array of cells, each holding a character and a set of foreground and background styles.
Events are how a terminal communicates changes in its state; each event
represents some form of action by the user, be it a keypress or a window resize.
Each terminal has an event stream that receives input events and buffers them
until they are read.

## Installation

Installation is simple, to use `rustty`, first add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
rustty = "*"
```

Then, add this to your crate root:

```rust
extern crate rustty;
```

## Concepts

The purpose of this section is to introduce and explain the main concepts of
rustty and the decisions behind its design.

### Terminal

The terminal representation can be thought of as such:

```
0-------------------------------cols (x)
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
rows (y)
```

Along the x-axis are the columns and along the y-axis are the rows. The
upper-left corner is the origin, which begins at index (0, 0) and extends to
(cols, rows). Each point (x, y) represents a single cell, which is the next
topic.

### Cells

A cell is a single unit on a character display, it represents a single
character, and its foreground and background styles. A terminal is a large array
of cells.

### Events

Events are how changes in a terminal's state are represented. 
A terminal has an associated event stream which acts much like a UNIX pipe,
or a FIFO queue. When events occur they are pushed on to
the back of the stream; when events are read they are taken
from the front of the stream.

## Usage Guide

Examples and usage suggestions can be found in the [API
documentation][1].
